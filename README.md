# learning-code
A repository that showcases my journey in learning how to code.

I update this repository just about weekly with any new projects that I have taken on in the past week.
I use this as a place to show and keep track of my progress as a software engineer. 
I hope to look back on this repository in a few days, a few months, and a few years and to continually see improvement in my
code. I want to be the best software engineer that I can be and this is part of the journey to getting there.
